Do this from a different, secure computer.</li><li>Review your system for compromise by checking for unexpected processes, network connections, or file modifications. Consider restoring from a clean backup or reimaging affected systems.</li><li>Update to a safe version if one exists, or find an alternative package. Check the package's repository and security advisories for guidance.</li><li>Scan your codebase for any malicious code that may have been injected into your project files during the package's execution.</li><li>Review your security practices including how you vet dependencies and consider using tools that scan for malicious packages before installation.</li>
